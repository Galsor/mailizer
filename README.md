Mailizer
==============================

An email processing pipeline based on Melusine aiming to perform topic extraction and email classification.


## Initialisation 
### Instanciate your virtual environment. 
``` make create_environment``` 
### (optional) Create your credentials.json 

**These steps are mandatory if your raw data are stored in Google Drive Spreadsheet**
1. Head to Google Developers Console and create a new project (or select the one you already have).
2. In the box labeled “Search for APIs and Services”, search for “Google Drive API” and enable it.
3. In the box labeled “Search for APIs and Services”, search for “Google Sheets API” and enable it.
4. Go to “APIs & Services > OAuth Consent Screen.” Click the button for “Configure Consent Screen” and follow the directions to give your app a name; you don’t need to fill out anything else on that screen. Click Save.
5. Go to “APIs & Services > Credentials”
6. Click “+ Create credentials” at the top, then select “OAuth client ID”.
7. Select “Desktop app”, name the credentials and click “Create”. Click “Ok” in the “OAuth client created” popup.
8. Download the credentials by clicking the Download JSON button in “OAuth 2.0 Client IDs” section.
9. Move the downloaded file to `~/.config/gspread/credentials.json`. Windows users should put this file to `%APPDATA%\gspread\credentials.json`.
